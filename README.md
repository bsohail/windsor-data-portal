# windsor-data-portal
The city of Windsor currently has an online web application for open data that is accessible by any individual from the public and now the city has asked our team to make a new and improved version of this product. The current data portal is for municipal institutions only, however the vison of our team is to be more inclusive and allow private institutions to share their data as well. Not only that but we want to improve the user interaction whit this data, something that is further elaborated on in this report. Our project name is Windsor-DataPortal, WDP and our team have gone thought two iterations of the development phase. this report talks about the results of the current product and the journey we took in reaching this endpoint. Our first phase was adopting new technology for the project and learning how to interact with it. We used tools such as GitHub, for team collaboration, Jira for project management and introduced ourselves to new web design concepts/tools relating to frontend and backend design. In our second phase, we clearly did not finish our product, but we took steps for having a working prototype.
